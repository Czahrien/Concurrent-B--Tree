% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Mapping data strucures are a critical part of many applications. As multi-processor
environments become more popular, programs have responded by implementing
more concurrency to take advantage of the extra processing power. Because maps
play a large role in many of these applications, it's important to have a 
mapping data structure that supports concurrent operations on it, without
locking the entire structure.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
We implemented a concurrent B\textsuperscript{+}-Tree to see how feasible a
concurrent mapping data strucure, with minimum locking, would work.
B\textsuperscript{+}-Trees are commonly used in database applications, where
several clients could be requesting reads and writes at the same time. In this
application, having a concurrent B\textsuperscript{+}-Tree that minimizes
locking could have a very significant impact on performance.

\section{Sequential Implementation}

\section{SMP Implementation}
\subsection{Searching}
Our main goal in this area is to allow searching without locking the tree to
allow for searches to be as parallelizable as possible. This will allow for
the tree to be heavily used by multiple cores concurrently and confer a
noticeable performance gain over a sequential program or a tree that uses some
sort of locking mechanisms for a search.

The only modification made to the sequential search in the SMP application is
that a lock is checked to see if an insertion is currently being performed 
(removals, being glorified insertions, are accounted for as well). This is 
because it is incredibly difficult and inefficient for nodes to check and
account for nodes changing under them.
\subsection{Insertion}
Insertion requires locking of the tree, there was no effective way to lock 
subtrees in a way that allowed for searches to occur concurrently with
insertions. Every approach we attempted was met with undefined behavior and
proved to be ineffective in high-stress situations.

The approach we settled on was a blocking queue approach. When a process wants 
to insert a value into the tree, the key-value pair is qeueued up and inserted
into the tree at a later time. The reasons for this approach are threefold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Work will be done by another thread so the thread inserting the value can
continue work elsewhere.
\item The insertion thread knows exactly when to lock and unlock the tree
structure so that a minimal amount of potential searching time is lost.
\item This approach results in an \emph{observed} speedup due to insertions being
deferred.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Performance}
\subsubsection{Searching}
Searching, for the most part, showed great results as concurrent searches
are massively parallelizable. However due to cache thrashing, the inability to
align to cache boundaries, and potentially some memory traffic issues, we 
observed a lower speedup than we expected. It is impossible to align the 
threads to cache boundaries due to their excessive memory lookups in searching. 
This is further compounded by the irregular memory usage of the tree caused by
node splitting that prvents larger trees from taking advantage of spatial 
locality of the used data (which leads to more cache misses than programs with
a more conventional behavior).

Despite this, speedups for very stressful loads were observed (eight threads,
each performing 125,000 lookups):
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} { | r | c | c | c | c |}
\hline
\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Search performance (1000000 searches), nodes of size 100}\\\hline\hline
K & Time (msec) & Speedup & Eff & EDSF \\\hline
seq & 1756 & n/a & n/a & n/a \\\hline
1 & 1749 & 1   & 1  & n/a \\\hline
2 & 823 & 2.13 & 1.07  & -0.06 \\\hline
3 & 808 & 2.17 & 0.72 & 0.19 \\\hline
4 & 681 & 2.57 & 0.64 & 0.18 \\\hline
5 & 710 & 2.47 & 0.49 & 0.26 \\\hline
6 & 724 & 2.42 & 0.40 & 0.29 \\\hline
7 & 623 & 2.81 & 0.40 & 0.25 \\\hline
8 & 479 & 3.67 & 0.46 & 0.17 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\subsubsection{Insertion}
Insertion shows less favorable results. During a high-stress amount of 
insertions (e.g. eight threads rapidly inserting elements) a slowdown is 
observed due to the blocking nature of Java's \texttt{LinkedBlockingQueue<E>}. But
luckily this is a rare use-case and in the more reasonable case of two threads 
rapidly inserting elements a small speedup is observed. This speedup is small 
enough that it does not warrant a data-table.

\section{Cluster Implementation}
For the cluster implementation of our B\textsuperscript{+}-Tree, we decided that
the message passing overhead from insertion operations that required cascading
splits in the tree would be too great to warrant splitting the tree across
multiple backend nodes. To get a faster implementeation, we decided to cut out
the movement of subtrees between nodes by making all of the nodes mirrors of
each-other. This way, each node has the exact same tree and any re-balancing as
a result of a split would only happen local to each node. This distributed
mirror approach is often taken when building distributed databases that have a
heavy search load\footnote{BigTable, for example, is designed so that the
samedata is always copied across at least 3 nodes.}

\subsection{Searching}
Because all of the back-end nodes are the same, searching through the tree is
fast. The master node delegates work out evenly between all of the nodes,
because searching has no side effects.

\subsection{Insertion}
To insert into the tree, we need to insert into {\em all} of the trees in our
backend nodes. We can accomplish this by putting the insert into the task queue
\--- when the master gets to that task, it adds the insertion to all of the nodes.

\subsection{Task Queue}
The master node has a queue of all of the operations pending for the tree. The
approach here was very similar to question 2 of homework 4: We have a thread
unloading tasks from a central queue and dispatching them out to worker nodes.
Searching tasks are delegated in a rotating fashion between all of the servers.
For an insertion, we delegate an insertion task for all of the backend trees.
Because the master is in control of delegating tasks, it can send out search
queries to nodes that have already performed the insertion so we can still have
some concurrency, even when doing insertions.

\subsection{Performance}
We expected to see nice speedups for searching on the cluster, as with our SMP
implementation.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | r | c | c | c | c | }
\hline
\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Search performance (1000 searches)}\\\hline\hline
K & Time (msec) & Speedup({\small E}-2) & Eff({\small E}-2) & EDSF({\small E}-2) \\\hline
seq & 25 & \--- & \--- & \--- \\\hline
1&6246 & 0.400 & 0.400 & \--- \\\hline
2&2876 & 0.869 & 0.435 & 1.308 \\\hline
3&2777 & 0.900 & 0.300 & 1.166 \\\hline
4&3422 & 0.731 & 0.183 & 1.492 \\\hline
5&2870 & 0.871 & 0.174 & 1.185 \\\hline
6&3386 & 0.738 & 0.123 & 1.425 \\\hline
7&3224 & 0.775 & 0.111 & 1.338 \\\hline
8&2677 & 0.934 & 0.117 & 1.081 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The performance curve roughly matches our expections: There's a lot of overhead
involved with managing the task queue which falls on the root node, as seen by
the performance of a 1 node cluster that does all of the the queue management
{\em and} tree operations.

The cluster implemenation was significantly slower than the sequential
implementation. The overhead from managing the task queue and properly
delegating tasks out takes a huge hit on performance. The cluster implementation
didn't scale {\em quite} as well as we had hoped, but it's very hard to match
the speed when all of the data is stored in main memory. We think that if our
tree were stored in slower, tertiary memory (such as a hard drive) as many
B\textsuperscript{+}-trees are\footnote{Databases, the traditional application
for B\textsuperscript{+}-trees store most of their data on a tertiary storage
device}. Having a slower local lookup time would have made the message-passing
overhead worthwhile, because we could have many nodes doing local lookups at the
same time, which might take much longer than the time to transmit data.

\section{Conclusion}
Our concurrent B\textsuperscript{+}Tree did not perform as well as we expected.
With that being said, concurrent data structures are hard to create. Not only
do the programmers wish to ensure the integrity of the contents of the data 
structure over the course of its lifetime by observing and accounting for all
possible race conditions (and do so without adding additional ones), but also
create an efficient implementation with a minimal amount of overhead.
    Additionally, implementing the sequential B\textsuperscript{+}Tree proved
to be a major undertaking itself because neither of us ever actually created
or directly worked with one before this project. The most peculiar part of
these trees is that data is stored only at the nodes which necessitates that
Leaf and Internal nodes be treated different and have different edge-cases
accounted for.

Though our results were not ideal, they were promising. If we were to implement
our B\textsuperscript{+}Tree so that it was stored in tertiary storage, we
expect to see more favorable results. It was an interesting project, and it's
now clear why B\textsuperscript{+}Trees are the preferred choice for database
implementations, distributed and standalone.
